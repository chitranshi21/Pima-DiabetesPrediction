# Pima-DiabetesPrediction
This project explores Pima Dataset to classify Diabetes.

## Using Pima-Data to understand a ML Workflow
This project can be used as a template to understand and apply Machine Learning models on real world problems.

The project uses **Skilearn, numpy, pandas** as supporting libraries. 

The process of Machine Learning Consist of - 
- Collecting the Data. 
- Cleaning the Features, reducing the strongly corrilated columns.
- Understanding the behavior of the features (Curves and boundaries)
- Imputing 
- Partitioning the Data into Train and Test
- Selecting the ML algorithm
- Training the Model.
- Evaluating the Performance.
- Refining the Model.
- Trying more complex algorithm.
- Cross Validation.
- Understanding Where to Stop.!!

All the above steps are applied and used in the example. Please click on the Pima-Predictions.ipynb to see the flow.
